I'm a Portland, Oregon based full stack developer and mechanical engineer. I primarily focus on backend data ingestion and processing flows using C# and SQL. On the front end, I use React, Typescript, and Razor to support client facing production applications. Currently, I'm pursuing a data engineering path and hope for an opportunity to utilize this new skillset in the near future.

I specialize in .NET solutions for large scale enterprise systems hosted both on premise and on Azure. With almost a decade of industry experience, I understand firsthand the importance of well defined requirements, solid architecture, maintainable code, and simplicity. 

The ever changing landscape of the tech world complements my inherent curiosity and fear of stagnation. I am constantly on the lookout for ways to increase my knowledge as new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies emerge.

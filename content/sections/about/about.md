Hi, I'm Michael Aguilar, a Portland, Oregon based full stack developer and mechanical engineer. My main expertise lies in backend data ingestion and processing flows using C# and SQL. On the front end, I use React, Typescript, and Razor to support client facing production applications.

 Over the past decade I've specialized in .NET solutions for large scale enterprise systems hosted both on premise and on Azure. Working on these relatively large applications reinforced the necessity for writing clean, testable, and maintanable code. As a result, I consistently strive to architect simple, high quality solutions.  

The ever changing landscape of the tech world complements my inherent curiosity and fear of stagnation. I am constantly on the lookout for ways to increase my knowledge as new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies emerge. Currently, I'm pursuing a data engineering path and hope for an opportunity to utilize this new skillset in the near future.

# Personal Portfolio For Michael Aguilar

Full Stack Developer portfolio created using Gatsby, leveraging the Portfolio Minimal Starter by Konstantin Münster – [konstantin.digital](https://konstantin.digital). Portfolio will continue to be updated as I complete new projects. 

Static site will be hosted on Netlify and set up with continuous deployment pipeline. See reference documentation here: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/
